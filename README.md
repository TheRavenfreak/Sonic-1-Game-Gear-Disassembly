What's split in this version?
The music, block mappings, palettes, some object logic, some level layouts, level headers, and some art.

I've also identified most of the monitor code, some RAM offsets, and some of Sonic's logic.
This builds a 100% accurate rom. It however, will break if overflows are present. 

Update 1/16/2019:
Split the crabmeat, signpost, green hill zone swing object logic, and explosion logic. The ghz moving platform object is currently being split from the main
source file, and will be added to the object_logic folder.
